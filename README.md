# MuJoCo Camera Depth Test

A quick script to test the accuracy of the depth from an OpenGL camera visualized with MuJoCo.

To run (using MuJoCo with enhanced camera depth precision) see: https://github.com/aftersomemath/mujoco/tree/depth-precision

```bash
python camera_depth_test.py --use_renderer
```

Should display something like:

TODO: Clean up script and document procedure clearly.
